# ethereum-vuln-dataset

A curated corpus of **past security fixes** from the eleven production Ethereum
clients (five execution-layer, six consensus-layer). Every row is one historical
vulnerability fix — a merged PR, commit, advisory, or CVE — normalized to a
single schema, scored for security relevance, and tiered by evidence strength.

It is built for training and evaluating spec-compliance / audit tooling:
> *given the code state just before this fix, would the tool have caught the bug?*

Because Ethereum clients **silently patch** most vulnerabilities (no CVE, vague
commit message), the hard part is separating real fixes from the flood of
refactors, dep-bumps and release notes. That separation — **the gate** — is what
this README explains.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet("data/ethereum_vulns.parquet")   # or data/ethereum_vulns.csv

df[df.authority_tier != "C_candidate"]      # the essential slice (1,808 rows)
df[df.confidence == "high"]                 # strongest evidence only
```

**Browse it on GitHub:** [`data/ethereum_vulns.preview.csv`](data/ethereum_vulns.preview.csv)
renders as a table (key columns). Full data with inline pre/post code: [`ethereum_vulns.csv`](data/ethereum_vulns.csv) or the `.parquet`.

*(A HuggingFace `datasets` mirror under [`NyxFoundation/`](https://huggingface.co/NyxFoundation) is planned.)*

## Dataset at a glance

## How the corpus is built

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["11 client repos + spec repos"] -->|"crawl: advisories · stealth PRs · commits ·<br/>releases · CVE / OSV / RustSec / govulncheck"| B["raw snapshot<br/>18,475 rows"]
    B --> N{"de-noise<br/>(deterministic)"}
    N -->|"T1 release-note boilerplate  −11"| D["16,998 rows"]
    N -->|"T2 CI / docs / dep-bump meta-work  −1,417"| D
    N -->|"T2b NVD substring-match false positives  −49"| D
    D --> G[["THE GATE<br/>keep on evidence"]]
    G -->|"no security signal  −14,665"| X["dropped<br/>(low-signal)"]
    G -->|"≥ 1 signal"| K["curated<br/>2,225 rows"]
    K --> T["authority tiers · silent-fix LLM ·<br/>labels · dedup by fix commit"]
```

**"Gate-dropped"** = a row that survived de-noising but for which **no independent
security signal fired**. These 14,665 rows are things like plain refactors,
feature PRs, and non-security commits the keyword crawl happened to touch — kept
out of the curated set. (A learned LLM pass rescues the ones that *are* silent
fixes; see [Silent-fix detection](#silent-fix-detection).)

## The gate — what decides "in or out"

The gate keeps a row if **any one** independent signal fires (union = high
recall), then **tiers** it by how much evidence stacked up. No single heuristic
is trusted alone.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["a de-noised row"] --> Q{"any independent<br/>security signal?"}
    Q -->|"CVE / GHSA / RustSec id"| K
    Q -->|"rated severity<br/>(Critical…Low)"| K
    Q -->|"security keyword<br/>(score ≥ 0.5)"| K
    Q -->|"fix-verb × crash-class impact<br/>(“fix panic on …”)"| K
    Q -->|"LLM silent-fix classifier<br/>(prob ≥ 0.70)"| K
    Q -->|"STRIDE / CWE label<br/>(if classified)"| K
    Q -->|"none"| X["dropped"]
    K["kept"] --> C{"how strong is<br/>the evidence?"}
    C -->|"advisory id or rated severity"| TA["A_authoritative"]
    C -->|"≥ 2 independent signals"| TB["B_corroborated"]
    C -->|"single signal"| TC["C_candidate"]
```

| Tier | Meaning | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **A_authoritative** | carries an advisory id or an advisory-rated severity — a confirmed vulnerability | you want ground truth |
| **B_corroborated** | no id, but ≥ 2 independent signals agree (e.g. strong keyword **+** sensitive subsystem **+** LLM says silent-fix) | the default high-precision slice |
| **C_candidate** | a single signal fired — broad recall, noisier | you want maximum coverage |

The **essential slice** = A ∪ B. Each row also carries `n_signals` (how many
fired) and `confidence` (high/medium/low) so you can threshold further.

Pre-gate de-noising, in order (`pipeline/build_security_dataset.py`):

| Stage | Drops | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | release-note / urgency-template rows | a severity from a release header is never trusted (an old build read Nimbus's *"critical update required"* template as ~95 phantom criticals) |
| **T2** | CI / docs / dep-bump meta-work (title-anchored) | not a client-code vulnerability; rows citing an advisory id / strong vuln language / rated severity are protected |
| **T2b** | NVD substring-match false positives | `crawl_cve` matched "geth" inside `gethostbyaddr`, "Gether Technology", Linux `usb: g…` — glibc/X.Org/kernel CVEs, not client bugs |

## Silent-fix detection

Ethereum clients patch ~98–100% of vulnerabilities *silently*. Two research-backed
methods recover them (full write-up: [`docs/silent_fix_detection.md`](docs/silent_fix_detection.md)):

- **Patch backlinking** — start from a confirmed advisory (OSV/GHSA) and extract
  the exact fixing commit/version (`fix_commit`). Deterministic, high precision.
- **Training-free LLM classifier** (`collection/llm_classify_fixes.py`) — an
  LLM4VFD-style Chain-of-Thought over *diff + dev-artifacts + touched subsystem*,
  no fine-tuning. Runs on `gemma4:31b` (chosen by an [80-item eval sweep](docs/model_evaluation.md):
  F1 0.872, precision 0.895), or Claude / a local Ollama model. Diffs are served
  rate-limit-free from bare git clones by `collection/local_diffs.py`. This pass
  admitted **+453** silent fixes the deterministic gate had missed.

## Reproduce

The curated table is derived **deterministically** from the raw snapshot — no
network, no API key:

```bash
uv run python pipeline/build_security_dataset.py \
  --in  data/raw/train.classified.parquet \
  --out data/ethereum_vulns.parquet \
  --silent-fix-csv data/silent_fix_llm.csv      # optional: fold in the LLM signal
uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Re-collecting the raw snapshot (network-bound) or re-running the LLM
classification is documented under [`docs/`](docs/) and `collection/run_pipeline.sh`.
